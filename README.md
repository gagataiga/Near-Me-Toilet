## What is Near-Me-Toilet
"Near-me-toilet" is one of the application that can show you toilet or restrooms near you. User can post a toilet that they found somewhere.

## What I want to solve with this app
The reason why I created this app is because in countries other than Japan, toilets are charged and it is very difficult to find a toilet in an unknown place.
